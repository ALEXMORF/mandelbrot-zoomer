# Mandelbrot Zoomer

A fractal explorer that allows you to dive deep into the Mandelbrot fractal.

The explorer is rendered in real-time, therefore it's limited to zoom as far as 2^-45. Any deeper zoom would result in pixelation.

## Controls

Drag with mouse to change zoom points.

Space to zoom down, Shift-Space to zoom up.

Up Arrow key to increase the iteration count, Down Arrow key to decrease the iteration count.
